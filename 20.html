         <div class="c1">I’ve always loved spending way too much time on the computer, and spent my teens tinkering with Photoshop and building crappy websites.<br><br><br>
            After coming back to France in 2007, I became a freelance UI designer, working with companies such as Hipmunk, Intercom, and Le Monde.<br><br><br>
           Yet as it turns out, my path would lead back to computers: after moving to China in 2006, I ended up quitting my language studies and getting a job in Beijing as a web designer.
